This is the companion app to the Redux Architecture on SwitUI tutorial available at.  
https://danielbernal.co/redux-like-architecture-with-swiftui-middleware/

What we did in the second part.:

- Implemented Redux Middleware support to handle async operations
- Switched services to be Asynchronous using Combine
- Optimized the project using composition
- Rearranged everything in separate files and groups.
